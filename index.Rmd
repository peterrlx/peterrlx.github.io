Hi, I'm Peter Xue. My Chinese name is 鎔荔(Rong-li). Currently, I am a master student in Economics at Peking University HSBC Business School (expected to graduate in July 2024) and applying to PhD programs/RA positions. I built the website for application purpose.

### Personal
I have lived in Shanghai for more than 20 years (born and raised). In my spare time I like walking and exploring maps of big cities.
