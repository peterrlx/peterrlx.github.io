Firms are subject to investment adjustment costs and limited enforcement constraints while workers are allowed to endogenize their labor effort through bargaining protocols though they are randomly matched to firms that are able to decide vacancy postings. I find that financial frictions lead labor market variables to exhibit greater persistence in response to productivity shocks. The introduction of work effort bargaining increases the short-run volatility of unemployment and employment responses by approximately 40 percent compared to a fixed effort scenario, with limited impact on consumption and investment transition paths. Under the flexible wage setting, effort demonstrates a procyclical pattern, and the short-run adjustment of labor market variables takes longer in the presence of productivity shock disturbances than credit shock disturbances. Besides, my benchmark model is able to restore the negative slope of the Beveridge curve and account for about 38 percent of fluctuations in labor market tightness and 65 percent of fluctuations in job vacancies observed in the quarterly U.S. data. However, the model underpredicts these fluctuations, suggesting that the amplification effects of financial friction and labor effort may be mitigated by flexible wages. Next, I will introduce sticky wages into the model.\r\n“‘Iron rice bowl’ and earnings differentials in China”, 2023.\r\n \r\nAbstract: I combine China’s national urban household survey (UHS) data with income tax and social security contribution rule from 1986-2014 to study the labor earning outcomes of “iron rice bowl” (IRB) workers (i.e., state-employed workers in government or communist party organizations, public institutions, or state-owned enterprises with low unemployment risk).\r\nAnnual labor earning distribution\r\nAnnual labor earning by age\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers\r\nItem\r\ndescription\r\nPast course/thesis projects:\r\nsample1, sample2, sample3,\r\nCoding sample\r\nexternal link\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
