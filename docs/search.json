Firms are subject to investment adjustment costs and limited enforcement constraints while workers are allowed to endogenize their labor effort through bargaining protocols. Wages are sticky for existing workers but flexible for new hires. The initial response of effort exhibits a procyclical pattern in the flexible wage setting while being countercyclical in the sticky wage setting. The appearance of financial frictions and effort bargaining, when taken separately, lead to more sluggish impulse responses and persistent deviations of labor market variables. However, when the two forces are combined together, I find that effort bargaining dampens the amplification effect of financial frictions on long-run labor market volatility.\r\n“‘Iron rice bowl’ and earnings differentials in China”, 2023.\r\n \r\nAbstract: I combine China’s national urban household survey (UHS) data with income tax and social security contribution rule from 1986-2014 to study the labor earning outcomes of “iron rice bowl” (IRB) workers (i.e., state-employed workers in government or communist party organizations, public institutions, or state-owned enterprises with low unemployment risk). Preliminary results show that IRB workers with similar observable characteristics tend to earn 293.4 yuan (in 1986 price level) more than their non-IRB counterparts per year during 2002-09. The wage gap between IRB and non-IRB workers increased significantly after age 30.\r\nAnnual labor earning distribution\r\nAnnual labor earning by age\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers\r\nItem\r\ndescription\r\nCoding sample\r\n link\r\nPast independent projects:\r\nsample1, sample2, sample3,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
