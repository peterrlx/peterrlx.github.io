Firms are subject to\r\ninvestment adjustment costs and limited enforcement constraints while\r\nworkers are allowed to endogenize their labor effort through bargaining\r\nprotocols though they are randomly matched to firms that are able to\r\ndecide vacancy postings. My benchmark model (with flexible wage) is able\r\nto restore the negative slope of the Beveridge curve and account for\r\nabout 38 percent of fluctuations in labor market tightness and 65\r\npercent of fluctuations in job vacancies observed in the quarterly U.S.\r\ndata.\r\n“‘Iron rice bowl’ and earnings differentials in China”,\r\n2023.  \r\nAbstract: I combine China’s national urban household survey (UHS)\r\ndata with income tax and social security contribution rule from\r\n1986-2014 to study the labor earning outcomes of “iron rice bowl” (IRB)\r\nworkers (i.e., state-employed workers in government or communist party\r\norganizations, public institutions, or state-owned enterprises with low\r\nunemployment risk). Preliminary results show that IRB workers with\r\nsimilar observable characteristics tend to earn 293.4 yuan (in 1986\r\nprice level) more than their non-IRB counterparts per year during\r\n2002-09. The wage gap between IRB and non-IRB workers increased\r\nsignificantly after age 30.\r\nAnnual labor earning distribution\r\nAnnual labor earning by age\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOthers\r\nItem\r\ndescription\r\nCoding sample\r\n\r\nlink\r\nPast independent projects:\r\nsample1,\r\nsample2,\r\nsample3,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
