Firms are subject to investment adjustment costs and limited enforcement constraints while workers are allowed to endogenize their labor effort (determined by Nash bargaining) though they are randomly matched to firms that are able to decide vacancy postings. I calibrate the model by using U.S. quarterly data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
